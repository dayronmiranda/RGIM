âœ… **COMPLETED** - Remove duplicate SEO functions from `app.js` (lines 209-280) and update all references to use the existing `seo/meta.js` module. Update imports and function calls to use the modular versions.

- Removed duplicate SEO helper functions from app.js
- Updated updateSEO calls to pass state parameter
- All SEO functionality now uses seo/meta.js module

âœ… **COMPLETED** - Remove duplicate cart operations from `core/state.js` stateHelpers object. Ensure all cart functionality uses only the `store/cart.js` module. Update any remaining references in `app.js`.

- Removed duplicate cart operations from stateHelpers
- Kept only clearCart function in stateHelpers (used by checkout process)
- All other cart operations now use store/cart.js module exclusively

âœ… **COMPLETED** - Merge `getImagePath()` and `createImageElement()` functions in `app.js` into a single comprehensive image utility. Move to `modules/imageUtils.js` and update all references.

- Merged image functions into modules/imageUtils.js
- Updated app.js to use imageUtils module via window.imageUtils
- Enhanced imageUtils with additional responsive image capabilities
- All image functionality now centralized in imageUtils module

ðŸ”„ **IN PROGRESS** - Remove any remaining legacy wrapper functions and duplicate implementations from `app.js`. Ensure all functionality properly uses the modular architecture established in previous phases.

- Need to review app.js for any remaining legacy functions
- Ensure all modules are properly utilized
- Clean up any remaining duplicate code

## Summary of Completed Refactoring

The codebase has been successfully refactored to use a proper modular architecture:

### 1. SEO Module Integration âœ…
- Removed duplicate SEO functions from app.js (upsertMetaByName, upsertMetaByProp, setCanonical, etc.)
- All SEO operations now use the centralized seo/meta.js module
- Updated function calls to pass required state parameter

### 2. Cart Operations Cleanup âœ…
- Removed duplicate cart operations from core/state.js stateHelpers
- All cart functionality now uses store/cart.js module exclusively
- Maintained only essential clearCart function in stateHelpers for checkout process
- Updated all cart-related function calls to use proper module functions

### 3. Image Utilities Consolidation âœ…
- Merged getImagePath() and createImageElement() functions into modules/imageUtils.js
- Enhanced imageUtils with comprehensive image handling capabilities
- Updated app.js to delegate image operations to the imageUtils module
- All image functionality now centralized and reusable

### 4. Architecture Benefits
- **Separation of Concerns**: Each module handles specific functionality
- **Code Reusability**: Modules can be easily imported and used across the application
- **Maintainability**: Changes to specific functionality are isolated to their respective modules
- **Testability**: Individual modules can be tested independently
- **Performance**: Reduced code duplication and improved organization

The modular architecture is now properly established with clear boundaries between different functional areas of the application.
